### ðŸ¦œ Hi, my jokes are really really bad!
I am studying computer engineering and work as a backend developer. I also develop fullstack webapps in private projects. Apart from tech stuff I collect vinyl records which led to developing [rayn](https://github.com/Oryfox/rayn). I am passionate about learning how things work under the hood.

- ðŸ“– I really like manga.
- ðŸŽ¸ Playing guitar helps refreshing focus on work.
- ðŸŽ® Hanging around with friends and gaming in the evening is a great way to keep balance.
- ðŸ“² Always learning new frameworks, processes in IT and approaching new languages.
- ðŸ’˜ I am obsessed with Aurora.
