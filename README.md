# Heya!ðŸ‘‹ 

 - My name is Semih but on the internet I prefer Oryfox or just Ory :)
 - Music, Vinyl records, coding and other techstuff defines who I am and what I like.
 - Java is my mothertongue and I use Windows and macOS mainly, but already worked (and still work) with various Linux distributions.
 - Sometimes I also speak German or English.
